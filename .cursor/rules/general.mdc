# General Project Rules

## Project Identity

tuck is a modern, beautiful dotfiles manager CLI built with TypeScript. It prioritizes:

1. **Safety** - Never lose user data
2. **Beauty** - Polished terminal experience
3. **Git-native** - Built on git, abstracts complexity
4. **Zero-config** - Works immediately

## Tech Stack

- Runtime: Node.js 18+ (ESM only)
- Language: TypeScript 5.x (strict mode)
- Package Manager: pnpm 9+ (NEVER npm or yarn)
- CLI Framework: Commander.js
- Prompts: @clack/prompts
- Styling: chalk, boxen, ora
- Git: simple-git
- Validation: Zod
- Testing: Vitest
- Build: tsup

## Key Principles

1. Always validate user input
2. Create backups before destructive operations
3. Confirm dangerous actions with user
4. Provide helpful error messages
5. Show progress for long operations
6. End commands with next step suggestions

## Package Manager

ALWAYS use pnpm commands:
- `pnpm install` not `npm install`
- `pnpm test` not `npm test`
- `pnpm build` not `npm build`
